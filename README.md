Monfield is a tool for automating the update of a specific field in specific
record. The fields to query by and to update are read from a CSV file, and
the updates are written to a JavaScript file, that gets executed on a remote
mongo instance.

## Dependencies
Monfield requires the presence of the MongoDB CLI Client `mongo` to execute
database update operations. Please make sure that your mongo client version
matches your database server version. Monfield was tested with versions
`3.6` and `4.0` of the `mongo` shell and database.

Additionally, it requires `csvkit` to handle CSV files, specifically the
`csvcut`, `csvsql`, and `csvjson` utilities. It was tested on Debian with
the `csvkit-1.0.2-1` package.

## Usage
```
USAGE:

    monfield [REQUIRED-ARGUMENTS] [OPTIONS]


DESCRIPTION:

    monfield is a tool for automating the update of a specific field in
    specific record. The fields to query by and to update are read from
    a CSV file, and the updates are chunked into a number of JavaScript
    files, and then are executed on a remote mongo instance.


REQUIRED ARGUMENTS:

    --hostname ................ URL for the database, as host:port
    --authentication-database . authentication database
    --username ................ username to authenticate as
    --database-name ........... database in which the migration will run
    --collection-name ......... collection in which the migration will run
    --migration-file .......... CSV file that contains the field definitions
    --delimiter ............... Delimiting character of the input CSV file.
                                Will be inferred if not provided.
    --quotechar ............... Character used to quote strings in the
                                input CSV file.  Will be inferred if not
                                provided.
    --output-js-folder ........ path where the JS batch scripts will be
                                created. The scripts will be executed at
                                the end if --dryrun was not supplied.
                                The folder must not exist, as it will be
                                created by this script.


OPTIONS:

    -h, --help ................ print this help message
    --dryrun .................. print the mongo scripting calls instead
                                of executing them
    --query-value-constructor . constructor name to be called on every
                                query value, e.g. passing ObjectId will
                                call ObjectId("query-value") on query
                                values (Not passing this option means
                                that all query values are passed
                                literally)
    --update-value-constructor  constructor name to be called on every
                                update value e.g. passing ISODate will
                                call ISODate("update-value") on update
                                values (Not passing this option means
                                that all query values are passed
                                literally)


MIGRATION FILE:

    The migration file is a CSV file which is structured as follows:

        query-field,update-field
        query-value,update-value
        query-value,update-value
        query-value,update-value
        ...

    For each row containing a [query-value]-[update-value] pair, an
    update is executed; we find records where [query-field] is
    [query-value] and set their [update-field] to [update-value].
```

## Examples
### Update a Date Field in Records by _id
This CSV file contains pairs of _id and a date field. The first row declares
the field IDs. The rest of the rows are query-value and update-value
fields. Monfield will find records by their _id in the first column, and
will update their date field with the new date specified in the second
column.

```csv
_id,156231
5f5de62929bea0000119407a,2015-05-01T01:01:12Z
5f51685c640003000170dd93,2014-05-01T01:01:12Z
5f3a9b8534847200011774f6,2013-05-01T01:01:12Z
5f39a77f6fc9b20001dde8db,2012-05-01T01:01:12Z
5f39505e0bf7090001ddd668,2011-05-01T01:01:12Z
```

To execute this migration call monfield like:

```sh
monfield --hostname localhost:27017 --authentication-database authdb --username admin --database-name 121 --collection-name b0a1f011-423a-46fa-3e7c-0u27b581b917 --migration-file ./updates.csv --output-js-folder ./migration --query-value-constructor ObjectId --update-value-constructor ISODate
```

### Update a Date Field in Records by a Text Field
This CSV file contains pairs of strings from a name field, and dates from a
date field. The first row declares the field IDs. The rest of the rows are
query-value and update-value fields. Monfield will find records by the value
of their name in the first column, and will update their date field with the
new date specified in the second column.

```csv
156232,156231
My Soul, Your Beats!,2018-05-01T01:01:12Z
Brain Freeze,2016-05-01T01:01:12Z
Fly Me To The Moon,2011-05-01T01:01:12Z
Komm, Süsser Tod,2011-02-01T01:01:12Z
Hell March 2,2010-02-01T01:01:12Z
```

To execute this migration call monfield like:

```sh
monfield --hostname localhost:27017 --authentication-database authdb --username admin --database-name 121 --collection-name b0a1f011-423a-46fa-3e7c-0u27b581b917 --migration-file ./updates.csv --output-js-folder ./migration --update-value-constructor ISODate
```

Note that unlike in the previous example, we don't specify the ObjectId
query-value-constructor. This is because the first field this time is a
normal text field, and does not require a call to ObjectId(). We still
specify the ISODate update-value-constructor because our update values in
the second column are date values.
